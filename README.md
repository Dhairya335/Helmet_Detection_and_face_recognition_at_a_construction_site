# Helmet_detection_with_facial_recognition
A construction site, helmet miners, electricians, construction workers and other types of requirements in the work wear, can effectively protect the safety of personnel, but because of a series of not wearing the helmet caused by accident, give us a wake up call, some employees not wearing a helmet when the job itself will increase security risks, paying a little attention so it is possible to "sit out" a security risk or accident So in our project, number of people wearing helmets will be counted and those not wearing helmets will be recommended to wear which is necessary A camera will detect number of heads, those without helmets will be indicated with red spots Along with helmets, gloves and shoes will also be detected and if not wearing any then those parts will also be indicated as red spots.
